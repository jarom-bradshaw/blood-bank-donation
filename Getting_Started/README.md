Note: I did make this via AI, if anyone sees something they think should be included, please reply to this message. Please know that you can work on whatever part interests you. For example, if you want to work on the CRUD, you can work on that as soon as the HTML files are up, or if you want to work on python visualization, you can work on that too.
